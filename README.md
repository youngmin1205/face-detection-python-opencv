### Simple face detection using Python, OpenCV
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images.
Detect faces in videos using the face classifier of OpenCV. As videos are basically made up of frames, which are still images. So get the face detection for each frame in a video. 

#### How to
Use `python detect-face.py` to open the webcam and detect the faces.
